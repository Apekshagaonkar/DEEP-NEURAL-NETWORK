# NCF-Movie Recommendation System training a neural model to recommend movies to a user based on his recent ratings for movies she/he has watched.

The dataset we trained our model with is in the short_dataset.txt file.

Used Neural collaborative filtering framework
It was deep learning first layer would extract features.
The movies vector which is close to user vector in higher dimension(based on number of neuron) will have higher rating compared to one far from it.
And the bias for each movie will depend on the overall rating like if the movie is very successful or fail 
And the bias for each user depends on his average reaction to all movies like if he usually gives higher rating or gives lower rating to movie.
