# NCF-Movie Recommendation System

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Our aim is to predict the rating of the movie which is not rated by the user

## PAPER REFERED
This project is implementation of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05031.pdf) 

## DATA:
We will be using a The Movie dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) from the Kaggle platform which has a very good collection of datasets.
